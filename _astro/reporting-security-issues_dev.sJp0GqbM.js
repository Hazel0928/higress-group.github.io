# Reporting Security Issues

The Higress Group takes a rigorous standpoint in annihilating the security issues in its software projects. Higress is highly sensitive and forthcoming to issues pertaining to its features and functionality.

## REPORTING VULNERABILITY

If you have apprehensions regarding Higress's security or you discover vulnerability or potential threat, don\u2019t 
hesitate to get in touch with the Higress Security Team by dropping a mail at [higress@googlegroups.com]
(mailto:higress@googlegroups.com). In the mail, specify the description of the issue or potential threat. You are also urged to recommend the way to reproduce and replicate the issue. The Higress community will get back to you after assessing and analysing the findings.

PLEASE PAY ATTENTION to report the security issue on the security email before disclosing it on public domain.

* The reporter reports the vulnerability privately to Apache.
